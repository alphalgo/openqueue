# openqueue

> BE KNOWN: CODE IN HERE JUST TRIAL FOR MY PERSONAL STUDY, ACTUALLY SOME STUFF MAKE NO SENSE AND NO VALIDATE, SO DON'T USE IT EXCEPT YOU OWN RISK. AND I AM A FRESHBIRD FOR GO, MAYBE YOU WANT TO HELP ME TO MAKE PROMOTION, I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

Openqueue have similarity with openstack in some cases, which is an open data structure expanded from common queue. To itself I added fence and other fields to make itself more expansibility. But I haven't test it fully yet, so don't expect much more.

And if you want to more about it, here the [thought](https://github.com/i0Ek3/p0ints/blob/master/2020.0828-openqueue.md) please.
